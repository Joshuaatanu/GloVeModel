# GloVe Model for Igala Language

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for training a GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) model on Igala, a low-resource language. The project includes scripts for preprocessing the text data, training the GloVe model, evaluating the resulting word embeddings, and visualizing the embeddings using techniques such as t-SNE.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and tokenizing Igala text data.
- **GloVe Model Training**: Implementation of a GloVe model using PyTorch.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts to evaluate word embeddings using cosine similarity, intrinsic evaluation methods, and extrinsic tasks.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualization of word embeddings using t-SNE and Plotly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Pandas
- GPU

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scikit-learn plotly pandas
